# API Performance Validation Framework

A Python-based API Performance Validation framework built using Pytest to
measure response times, enforce SLA thresholds, track performance trends,
and monitor error rates.

---

## Objectives

This framework validates API performance by:

- Measuring API response times
- Enforcing threshold-based failures
- Reporting performance trends (average, p95, max)
- Monitoring API error rates
- Acting as a performance quality gate in CI

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pytest
- Requests
- Virtual Environment (venv)
